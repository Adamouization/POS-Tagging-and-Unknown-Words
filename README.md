# NLP: POS Tagger with Unknown Words Handling

This repository contains code developed for a Part Of Speech (POS) tagger using the Viberbi algorithm to predict POS tags in sentences in the Brown corpus. It contains the following features:
  * HMM word emission frequency smoothing;
  * Unknown word handling;
  * Extra unknown words rules based on their morphological idiosyncrasies;
  * HMM training data saving for quicker program execution.

The evolution of the tagger's accuracy using different methods can be seen below. The report can be visited [here](https://github.com/Adamouization/POS-Tagging-and-Unknown-Words/blob/master/report/report.pdf).

## Usage

Before running the program, create a new virtual environment to install Python libraries such as NLTK and run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the POS tagger in Python, move to the `src` directory and run the following command:

```
python main.py [-corpus <corpus_name>] [-r] [-d]
```

where:

* `-corpus`: is the name of corpus to use, which can be either `brown` or `floresta`. This is an optional argument that defaults to `brown` if nothing is specified.

* `-r`: is a flag that forces the program to recompute the HMMâ€™s tag transition and word emission probabilities rather than loading previously computed versions into memory.

* `-d` is a flag that enters debugging mode, printing additional statements on the command line.
